        <div class="description">
            <h2>Eucharistic Miracle of VILAKKANNUR</h2>
            <p>
                On **Nov. 15, 2013**, in Vilakkannur, a small village in the southern Indian state of Kerala, something extraordinary occurred during the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. The presiding celebrant, **Fr. Thomas Pathickal**, noticed a black dot on the consecrated host. Moments later, a human face appeared on the host.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perplexed, the priest beckoned the sacristan, who also confirmed that the picture of a face — believed to be the face of Jesus — had formed on the host. The congregation, not realizing what was going on at the altar, assumed that the priest was experiencing some physical difficulty and the sacristan had been called for help.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Mass, the priest revealed the phenomenon to the faithful, and the word spread like wildfire. Thousands gathered to witness what many called a miracle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because matters regarding faith require permission from the Holy See for public veneration, the host was removed from the local parish and safely kept elsewhere. It was later submitted for scientific investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                **This year, the Vatican officially recognized it as a Eucharistic miracle and granted permission for public veneration of the host.**
            </p>

            <p>
                The priest who witnessed the miraculous phenomena even asked, "Why me" and "Why Vilakkannur?" — a small hamlet in the diocese. Perhaps the only possible answer is that God's ways are beyond human understanding. And God, who chose to live among us in the humble form of bread and wine, does not require a grand place to reveal himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                While a large number of the faithful considered it a miracle, others have argued that every Eucharist is a miracle. From a theological standpoint, they contend that the extraordinary appearance does not necessarily constitute a Eucharistic miracle. Yet, in the eyes of simple faithful, it is indeed a miracle: God chose to reveal himself to people in the consecrated bread.
            </p>

            <p>
                The significance of the Holy Eucharist is invaluable in Catholic life. The Eucharist is the greatest miracle on Earth, a living memorial of the Last Supper of Jesus. In every celebration, Jesus comes to us in the form of body and blood, offering life to all who receive him in faith.
            </p>

            <p>
                But a deeper question remains: Do I see the face of Christ in the bread I receive? Do I truly experience the real presence of Jesus in every Eucharist I attend?
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from epistemological and theological arguments, the Eucharistic miracle at Vilakkannur serves as more than a moment of wonder. It is a profound invitation. It calls each of us to recognize the face of Jesus not only on the altar but also in the people around us. Just as we gaze with reverence upon his face in the Eucharist, we are invited to look at others with the same eyes — eyes of love, mercy and compassion.
            </p>

            <p>
                The miraculous image of Jesus on the host at Vilakkannur seems to whisper a gentle message to all the faithful: "See me in your brothers and sisters. Treat them as you would treat me."
            </p>

            <p>
                [Personal Reflection on the importance of daily Mass, a friend's dedication, and the realization of the Eucharist's significance.]
            </p>

            <p>
                How true it is that God chooses to reveal himself to the innocent and childlike. The Eucharistic miracle cannot be grasped by logic alone. It requires a heart of faith — an inner eye to see through and beyond.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every Eucharist gives us an upper room experience. We are invited to encounter that young man — Jesus — sharing his final message of love and breaking himself as the ultimate sign of that love. The Eucharist is our daily dose of energy, the answer to all our struggles.
            </p>

            <p>
                The real presence of Jesus in the form of bread and wine — his body and blood — reminds me of the virtue of humility. Unlike the God of the Old Testament, who walked with the Israelites in the form of a cloud and a pillar of fire, Jesus chose to be present in the form of food. How great is our God, who can humble himself down to the level of human beings.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Real Presence also challenges me: "Do I become a source of nourishment and strength for my brothers and sisters? Am I willing to be broken for others?" Every time I receive the body and blood of Christ he whispers in my heart, "Do unto others as I have done to you." It is an invitation to give of myself, from my own sources and resources in pure love and generosity.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe in a God who is living in us and with us. He is present in every Eucharist, in every tabernacle, and in every heart that receives him.
            </p>
