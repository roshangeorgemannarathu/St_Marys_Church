            <h2>History of St. Mary’s Church, Manalumkal</h2>

            <p>Located east of Kottayam — the city often described as the “Land of Letters and Culture” — lies the beautiful and fertile village of Poovathilappu. This land, blessed with richness and greenery, is a vivid representation of agrarian Kerala. Most of its inhabitants are farmers engaged in agriculture.</p>
            <p>In the old days, when transport facilities were scarce, Poovathilappu — an inland village — served as a resting place for people who travelled on foot from various nearby regions such as Pala, Muttuchira, Paika, and Kodungoor. It is said that the name “Poovathilappu” originated from a large Poovam tree that once stood there, under which there was a resting platform (called Ilappu), along with a nearby pond.</p>
            <p>As time passed, this area became the administrative hub of the region known as Akalakkunnam, and establishments such as trade centers, the Panchayat office, Village office, and Post office were set up here. To spread knowledge, a school was founded, and to nurture faith, a church grew close by — on a nearby elevated region called **Manalumkal**.</p>
            <p>When the idea of starting a school first arose, a suitable location was sought. It was found at the higher area of Manalumkal Thakidiyil, which was not particularly fertile and was mostly sandy — hence the name **Manalumkal** (“land of sand”). Later, when it was realized that the spiritual needs of the school children also required attention, a small chapel was established near the school to serve as a center for prayer and devotion.</p>
            <p>That small chapel gradually became the spiritual heart of the region — the St. Mary’s Church, Manalumkal, which continues to shine as a symbol of faith today. Thus, the origin of Manalumkal Church is closely intertwined with the establishment and growth of the local school.</p>

            <h2>Beginnings of the School and Chapel</h2>
            <p>
            In **1924**, under the leadership of **Rev. Fr. Mathai Moongamackal**, **St. Aloysius English Middle School** began functioning, and by **1949**, it was upgraded to a High School. Alongside the pursuit of worldly knowledge, Fr. Mathai and the parents also felt the necessity of a place for the students to nurture their spiritual growth.
            </p>
            <p>
            Consequently, in **1955**, under the chairmanship of **Fr. Joseph Periyappuram**, the school committee decided to build a chapel for meditation and worship. On November 5, 1955, the secretary, Mr. A.L. Joseph Maniyangatt, was entrusted with purchasing the land for the chapel.
            </p>
            <p>
            The succeeding headmaster, **Rev. Fr. Zacharias Poovathingal**, began the construction efforts. The foundation stone of the chapel — dedicated to **Our Lady of Fatima** — was laid in **December 1956** by **Mar Sebastian Vayalil**, the first Bishop of Palai. The local people wholeheartedly cooperated — raising funds, donating timber, and offering voluntary labor. The church was blessed and inaugurated on **December 8, 1958**, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, by Bishop Sebastian Vayalil. Holy Mass and other religious services began to be regularly held there.
            </p>

            <h2>Growth into a Parish</h2>
            <p>
            Since the church remained an open structure reminiscent of a school building, it was later decided to build walls and beautify it. Under the leadership of **Rev. Fr. Michael Thekkel**, the church was rebuilt, and from **April 1962** onward, it became a permanent chapel with a resident priest. Daily Mass and other services began to be conducted regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
            In **June 1965**, Sunday School was started for children from nearby parishes — Kanjiramatam, Muzhoor, Kozhuvanal, and Muttuchira — making it a spiritual center for young believers. Efforts to elevate the chapel to parish status also began around this time. A 13-cent plot adjacent to the chapel was purchased from Ouseph Devasia, Payyanimandapam, for future expansion.
            </p>
            <p>
            In **1973**, **Rev. Fr. Isaac Kulathingal**, the new headmaster, built the sacristy near the church and took great interest in developing both the school and the church surroundings. He constructed compound walls around both the church and school and planted coconut trees. Later, in **1982**, **Rev. Fr. Mathew Munduvala** installed a church gate and arranged a drinking water facility for the school.
            </p>
            <p>
            In **1984**, under the leadership of **Rev. Fr. Mathew Mampuzhakkunnel**, then vicar of Kanjiramatam Church, the Manalumkal chapel was officially elevated to the status of a **substation (Kurisupalli)** of Kanjiramatam Parish. On **May 2, 1985**, **Rev. Fr. Joseph Eenthanal** was appointed as the first vicar of this substation. He, along with the faithful, worked earnestly to have the substation recognized as an independent parish. On December 3, 1986, 167 families (91 from Kanjiramatam, 48 from Kozhuvanal, 19 from Muzhoor, and 7 from Muttuchira) jointly signed and submitted an application to the bishop for the same.
            </p>

            <h2>Formation of Manalumkal Parish</h2>
            <p>
            On **December 18, 1986**, Bishop Joseph Pallikkaparambil appointed a commission — consisting of Rev. Fr. Mathew Madathikunnel, Rev. Fr. Francis Parappurathu, and Rev. Fr. Abraham Kaniyampady — to study the feasibility of forming the new parish. After reviewing their report and consultations with clergy and lay representatives from nearby parishes, the Bishop issued Decree No. 115 on **February 15, 1987**, officially establishing **Manalumkal Parish**.
            </p>
            <p>
            **Rev. Fr. Joseph Eenthanal** was appointed as its **first vicar**. A total of **215 families** from various neighboring parishes were incorporated into the new parish. To provide financial support, the Bishop allocated assets and funds — including 2.5 acres of land and Mundenkunnu Kurisupalli (from Kanjiramatam), ₹1,10,000 from Kozhuvanal Parish, ₹25,000 from Muzhoor Parish, and contributions from Muttuchira Parish.
            </p>
            <p>
            Later, an additional 2 acres of land were purchased at Vadakkekkuttu Parambu, Poovathilappu, as well as half an acre for the cemetery and one acre for parish income from Thomman Eyalel in 1987. Another half-acre plot was purchased from Baby Maniyangatt the same year.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since its establishment, the **Feast of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception** has been celebrated as the main parish feast, held annually on the **third Sunday of January**. The parish gratefully remembers the unselfish contributions and sacrifices of its members, which have fueled its steady growth — both spiritual and material.
            </p>

            <h2>Later Developments</h2>
            <p>
            In **1987**, a parish census was completed, and the families were organized into five wards, with ward prayer meetings started soon after. On **February 2, 1991**, the first vicar, Fr. Joseph Eenthanal, retired, and **Rev. Fr. Augustine Theruvath** took charge as the new vicar. Under his guidance, a self-help group was started under the Pala Society, introducing social welfare programs, savings schemes, and marriage assistance projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            With the cooperation of the Vincent de Paul Society, Yuvashakti, and other parish organizations, the parish launched a **house construction program** to assist the needy — a memorable milestone in its social outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
            On **February 2, 1996**, Fr. Augustine Theruvath was transferred to Chennad Parish, and **Fr. Joseph Madappallimattam** was appointed as the new vicar. During his tenure, the **Mundenkunnu Kurisupalli** was rebuilt and blessed on **October 10, 1998**, by Mar Joseph Pallikkaparambil.
            </p>
            <p>
            In **February 2002**, **Rev. Fr. Jose Mulanjenal** became the vicar. During this period, the cemetery construction was completed, and the cemetery road was tarred, improving access. The five wards were reorganized into **eleven family units**, which remain active and vibrant in parish life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Acknowledging the continuous support of parish assemblies and members, the parish fondly remembers their role in fostering both spiritual and material development.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Construction of the New Church</h2>
            <p>In **April 2005**, the parish general body decided to construct a **new church building** to meet the spiritual and communal needs of the growing parish. A Church Construction Fund was established, supported by offerings from the first Sunday adoration services each month and generous contributions from parishioners. Through the collective effort, unity, and dedication of the faithful, this long-cherished dream became a reality. The **new St. Mary’s Church, Manalumkal**, was completed and solemnly inaugurated on **December 26, 2010**, by **Mar Joseph Kallarangatt**, marking a historic milestone in the parish’s journey of faith and togetherness.</p>
