                <img src="Carlo_Acutis.jpg" alt="St. Carlo Acutis" class="section-img"/>
                <p>
                    Carlo Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London, to Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano. 
                    From a young age, Carlo displayed a profound love for God and the Church that inspired his parents. 
                    His family later moved to Milan, Italy, where Carlo’s passion for computer programming blossomed 
                    alongside his deepening faith. His feast day is celebrated on <b>October 12</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Canonization</h3>
                <img src="carlo_ Canonisation.jpg" alt="Canonisation of Carlo Acutis" class="section-img"/>
                <p>
                    St. Carlo Acutis was canonized on <b>September 7, 2025</b>, becoming the first millennial saint. 
                    Known for his devotion to the Eucharist and skill with technology, Carlo created a website documenting 
                    Eucharistic miracles worldwide. His beatification took place in 2020 after the recognition of his first miracle, 
                    and a second miracle led to his canonization.
                </p>

                <h3>Devotion & Contributions</h3>
                <img src="carlolo_with_pc.jpg" alt="Carlo with Computers" class="section-img"/>
                <p>
                    At the age of seven, Carlo began attending daily Mass and praying the Rosary. 
                    He is remembered for his words: <i>“The Eucharist is my highway to Heaven”</i>. 
                    Using his programming skills, he cataloged 187 Eucharistic miracles across the world, 
                    making him known as the “Patron Saint of the Internet.” 
                </p>
