                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>Euphrasia, born Rosa Eluvathingal, came into the world on 17 October 1877 in Kattoor, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur district, Kerala. She grew up in a Syro-Malabar Catholic family and was deeply influenced by the faith and traditions of her community. As a young girl, she is said to have had a vision of the Holy Family, after which her long illness disappeared.</p>

                    <h3>Religious Life</h3>
                    <p>Rose entered the boarding school of the Congregation of the Mother of Carmel at Koonammavu, the first indigenous congregation of Syro-Malabars.</p>
                    <p>From 1904 to 1913, Sr Euphrasia served as novice mistress at St Joseph's Convent. From 1913 to 1916, she was Mother Superior of the Convent of St Mary at Ollur. She endeavoured to lead a life of constant prayer and of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, becoming known to many people as the Praying Mother.</p>
                    <p>She died on 29 August 1952.</p>

                    <h3>Miracles</h3>
                    <p>The first reported miracle was curing a carpenter from bone cancer. Thomas Tharakan from Anchery in Ollur, a furniture polishing worker, was diagnosed with cancer by the Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute in Thrissur. Thomas was admitted to the hospital for one week. Later, before the surgery, a scan by the doctor showed no sign of tumour, despite an earlier scan report showing clear evidence of a tumour. Thomas's sister, Rosy, later claimed that the cure was the result of her prayer to Euphrasia.</p>
                    <p>The second reported miracle happened to a seven-year-old child named Jewel from Aloor in Thrissur District. The child had a tumour in his neck which made it difficult for him to swallow any food. Doctors at Dhanya Hospital in Potta, Thrissur District, had said that this disease was incurable. As Jewel's family came from a poor background, their only option was to pray for divine intercession. After his grandmother prayed to Euphrasia, doctors noticed that his tumour began to shrink. Dr Sasikumar of Dhanya Hospital examined him once again and found the tumour to have disappeared. Many other doctors examined the boy and stated that there was no medical basis for this event.</p>

                <div class="section-text">
                    <h3>Veneration</h3>
                    <p>On 27 September 1986 the process of canonisation began in Ollur. Father Lucas Vithuvatikal CMI was subsequently appointed as Postulator. On 29 August 1987, Euphrasia was declared a **"Servant of God"** on the same day.</p>
                    <p>Sister Perigrin was appointed as Vice-Postulator on 9 September 1987, and in 1988 a Diocesan Tribunal for the Cause of Euphrasia was established by Kundukulam. An apostolic miracle was established on 8 January 1989, and the tribunal concluded its work on 19 June 1991. On 30 January 1990 the tomb of Euphrasia was opened and her remains were transferred to a newly built tomb inside the chapel of St. Mary's Convent. Her case was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome on 20 April 1994, and on 5 July 2002 Pope John Paul II declared her **"Venerable"**.</p>
                    <p>She was **beatified on 3 December 2006** in St. Anthony's Forane Church, Ollur, with the declaration of the Major Archbishop, Varkey Vithayathil, on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
                    <p>On 3 April 2014, Pope Francis authorised the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to promulgate the decrees concerning the miracle attributed to Euphrasia's intercession. This confirmed the Pope's approval of Euphrasia's canonisation. At a special Mass held at St Peter's Square at Vatican City on **23 November 2014**, Pope Francis **canonised Euphrasia as a saint**. Mother Sancta, Mother General of the Congregation of the Mother of Carmel (CMC), carried the relics of Euphrasia to the altar.</p>

                    <p>St. Euphrasia’s tomb at St. Mary’s Convent, Ollur, has become a place of pilgrimage. Her life of prayer and humility continues to inspire the faithful, and she is venerated as a model of holiness in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.</p>
