            <h3 id="early-life" class="section-heading">Early Life & Faith</h3>
            <p>Carlo Acutis was born in London to Italian parents, **Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano**, and later moved to Milan. Despite his parents not being particularly devout, Carlo showed a deep love for the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary from a young age, inspiring his own mother to renew her faith.</p>
            <p>He received his **First Holy Communion at age seven**, a year earlier than the usual age, after obtaining special permission. From that moment, he attended **daily Mass and prayed the Rosary daily**.</p>
            <p>Carlo viewed the Eucharist as his "highway to Heaven." He frequently told his parents that people "are born originals but many die as photocopies," urging them to seek holiness.</p>
            <div class="section-img">
                <img src="carlo_early_life.jpg" alt="Carlo's Family or childhood" />
            </div>

            <h3 id="digital-apostle" class="section-heading">Digital Evangelization</h3>
            <p>Carlo was a typical teenager, enjoying video games and computers, but he channeled his passions toward his faith. He possessed a remarkable talent for computer programming, often self-teaching using university textbooks. He decided to use the internet—which he referred to as a means of communication and evangelization—to share his faith.</p>
            <p>He created a **website cataloging Eucharistic miracles** and apparitions across the world, which took him nearly four years of research and compilation. He saw this project as a way to defend the faith against doubt, believing that people would become more devout if they knew the proofs of Christ's real presence in the Eucharist.</p>
            <p>This work earned him the moniker **"Patron of the Internet"** or "Cyber-Apostle of the Eucharist," showcasing how modern technology can be used as a tool for holiness.</p>
            <div class="section-img">
                            </div>

            <h3 id="eucharist" class="section-heading">The Five Musts of Carlo's Life</h3>
            <p>Carlo's spirituality revolved around five key points, which he called his "five musts":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Daily Mass:** The Eucharist as his "highway to Heaven."</li>
                <li>**Daily Rosary:** Trusting in the Blessed Virgin Mary.</li>
                <li>**Weekly Confession:** To keep his soul clean.</li>
                <li>**Eucharistic Adoration:** Seeing it as a personal dialogue with Jesus.</li>
                <li>**Service to Others:** He volunteered at soup kitchens and cared for the poor in his community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He often used a simple analogy for his soul: "The soul is like a hot-air balloon. If you put too much ballast in the form of even venial sins, the balloon cannot go up. We need to remove the ballast as soon as possible so that the soul can soar."</p>
            <div class="section-img">
                <img src="magis-4-contemporary-eucharist-cover-1700x850.jpg" alt="Eucharistic adoration" />
            </div>

            <h3 id="beatification-miracle" class="section-heading">Illness, Death, and Canonization</h3>
            <p>In early October 2006, Carlo contracted **fulminant leukemia** (M3 subtype), a rapidly aggressive form of the disease. He offered his suffering to the Lord for the Pope and the Church, stating: **"I offer to the Lord the suffering that I will have to undergo for the Pope and for the Church, so as not to go to Purgatory, but to go straight to Heaven."**</p>
            <p>He died just days later, on **October 12, 2006**, at the age of 15, and was buried in Assisi, a place he loved due to its association with St. Francis of Assisi.</p>
            <p>Carlo was **beatified** on October 10, 2020, after Pope Francis recognized the first miracle attributed to him: the inexplicable healing of **Matheus Vianna**, a Brazilian boy suffering from a rare pancreatic disorder.</p>
