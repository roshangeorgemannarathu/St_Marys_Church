                <h3>Life</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyan was born in Puthenchira on 26 April 1876 as the third of five children of Thoma and Thanda and was baptized on 3 May 1876 at the church of Saint Mary, named in honor of Teresa of Ávila. Her paternal uncle Antony Chiramel Mankidiyan was her godfather and his wife Anna was her godmother. The family lost wealth after providing dowries for her grandfather's daughters. She had two sisters and two brothers in exact order: Porinchu, Mariamkutty, Ouseph and Ittianam – she was born between Mariamkutty and Ouseph.</p>

                        <p>In 1884 her mother tried to dissuade her from severe fasts and night vigils. Her mother died on 2 March 1888. Thresia dedicated herself to contemplation and privately vowed to remain chaste in 1886. She attempted to leave home for penance in 1891 but returned. From 1904 she desired to be called **"Mariam"** after a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. From 1902 to 1905 she underwent several exorcisms and her spiritual director, Joseph Vithayathil, guided her until her death.</p>

                        <p>In 1903 she requested Archbishop John Menachery to build a retreat, which was turned down. She formed a group of three friends for apostolic work. After attempts with Carmelites and Franciscan Clarists, she **founded the Congregation of the Holy Family on 14 May 1914**, where she was the first superior.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>She was said to have received **stigmata** first in 1905, becoming more visible on **27 January 1909**. She also experienced demonic attacks. In 1926 a falling object struck her leg, which became infected. She was admitted to a hospital but later moved to her convent, where she received the final sacraments and the Viaticum on 7 June 1926.</p>

                        <p>She died at 10 pm on **8 June 1926** from her leg wound worsened by diabetes. Her final words were: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph; I give you my heart and my soul." She was laid on the floor as per her request, with her spiritual director and fellow religious around her. Her funeral was celebrated on 9 June, and her remains were not washed as per her wishes.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The beatification process opened in Irinjalakuda on 12 July 1982 and she was declared Servant of God. Pope John Paul II declared her Venerable on 28 June 1999.</p>

                        <p>The miracle required for beatification involved the cure of **Mathew D. Pellissery**, born in 1956 with congenital **club feet**. After 33 days of fasting and prayer invoking Mariam Thresia, his right foot was straightened on 21 August 1970, and the left foot on 28 August 1971. This miracle was approved, and Pope John Paul II **beatified her on 9 April 2000**.</p>

                        <p>The second miracle for canonization involved the healing of a child named **Christopher**. Pope Francis approved this miracle on 12 February 2019, leading to her **canonization on 13 October 2019**.</p>
